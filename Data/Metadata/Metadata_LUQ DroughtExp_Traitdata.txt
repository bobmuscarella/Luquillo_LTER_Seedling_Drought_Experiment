### METADATA for LUQDrought_RootTraitData_2020-06-04.xlsx

## Data collected by Roel lammerant, J. Aaron Hogan & Robert Muscarella, January-february 2020, El Verde, Puerto Rico - in collaboration with Jess Zimmerman, Maria Uriate & David Matlaga.
## correspondence concerning these data should be directed to Roel Lammerant (Roel.lammerant@outlook.be).

## Description: 
Destructuvily harvesting of all the survivin seedlings in a seedling drought experiment in Luquillo, Puerto Rico.  
The experiment was located near the El Verde Field Station, in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and utilized PVC plastic rain-out shelters. 
Data were collected through the use of high precision scales, a flatbed scanner (CanoScan Lide 400), WinRHIZO and imageJ (Rueden et al. 2017)

## Metadata are in the form of: # Variable - description with units

# Variable list:

# Plot # - The plot number where the seedling was located, ranges from 1-60
# Position - The position in the 4x4 planted grid of seedlings within the plot, from 1 being top left to 16 being bottom right seedlings were numbered consecutively across in rows
# Species name - An eight level factor for denoting the six letter code of the species.  Codes are as follows: CECSCH - Cecropia schreberiana Miq. (Urticacee) , GUAGUI - Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer (Meliaceae),  INLAU - Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (Leguminosae), MANBID - Manilkara bidentata (A.DC.) A.Chev. (Sapotaceae), PREMON -  Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Graham) A.J.Hend. & Galeano (Arecaceae), SCHMOR- Schefflera morototoni (Aubl.) Maguire, Steyerm. & Frodin (Araliaceae),  TETBAL - Tetragastris balsamifera (Sw.) Oken (Burseraceae), UREBAC - Urera baccifera (L.) Gaudich. ex Wedd. (Urticaceae).
